# # Web scraping
#
# Why web scraping?
#
# Many experts have proposed that 80% of a machine learning/AI project is spent on data gathering and preparation, with 20% spent on training a model. For more on this topic, watch Dr. Andrew Ng's presention on data centric AI availble at https://youtu.be/06-AZXmwHjo.
#
# Data gathering is hard. If you can re-use data gathered by someone else, it can make your project possible. Note, reusing data collected for another purpose will still be hard and require quite a bit of data preparation.
#
# **The best tool to use is the one you already know.**
#
# Pandas has functionality that allows one to read in data from a variety of sources. Some include:
#
# * comma separated value or tab separated value files
# * databases (anything supported by SQLAlchemy)
# * web pages (finds all HTML tables)
#
# To learn more, see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_html.html. Note this method doesn't support https and has a few other gotchas.

# It appears that the player info is in a separate table from their stats. Let's combine the two.

# ## Web scraping using Selenium and a web browser
#
# For documentation on Selenium, see:
#
# * https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/index.html
# * https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/
#
# For a introductory tutorial, see https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/selenium-python/
#
# Selenium requires additional webdriver software that allows you to control Chrome, Firefox, etc. via Python.
#
# On macOS, you can use `brew` (https://brew.sh/) to install the dependencies:
#
# ```bash
# brew install geckodriver
# brew install chromedriver
# ```
#
# On Windows 10, you can use `choco` (https://chocolatey.org/) to install the dependencies (Run this in an Administrator shell):
#
# ```powershell
# # use this line to install firefox version
# choco install selenium-gecko-driver
# # use this line to install chrome version
# choco install chromedriver
# ```

# %%
from selenium import webdriver
from IPython.display import Image
from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait

# %%
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as firefoxoptions
options = firefoxoptions()
# comment out this line to see what's happening
options.headless = True
driver = webdriver.Firefox(options=options)
driver.set_window_size(1024,768)
driver.get(url)
driver.save_screenshot('firefox.png')

# %%
pprint(driver.capabilities)

# %%
Image(filename='firefox.png')

# %% [markdown]
# Alternatively use Chrome
# ```python
# from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options as chromeoptions
# options = chromeoptions()
# options.headless = True
# driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
# driver.set_window_size(640,480)
# driver.get(url)
# driver.save_screenshot('chrome.png')
# Image(filename='chrome.png')
# ```

# %%
page_html = driver.page_source

html_body = re.search(r'<body>.+</body>', page_html, flags=re.DOTALL)[0]
lines = re.findall(r'.+', html_body)
for n in range(20):
    print(lines[n])

# %%
driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('time')

# %%
for t in driver.find_elements_by_tag_name('time'):
    if t.get_attribute('id') is not '':
        print(t.text)

# %% [markdown]
# ### A slightly more advanced example
#
# Similar to web development, using Selenium for web scraping requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. One important skill to have is how to select elements from the document object model. There are various ways of identifying or selecting desired elements. Here are some references to learn more:
#
# * [The 30 CSS Selectors You Must Memorize](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048)
# * [CSS Selector Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)

# %%
driver.get('https://www.amazon.com')

# %%
search_box = driver.find_element_by_id('twotabsearchtextbox')
search_box.clear()
search_box.send_keys('512GB sd card\n')
search_box.submit()

# %% [markdown]
# Due to needing time for browser to load and render all content, if you run this next cell immediately after the previous one, it may fail.
#
# There are a few options to solve this issue:
#
# * Put in an explicit wait via `time.sleep()` call to help prevent problems.
# * Configure the driver to wait if an element found doesn't exist via `driver.implicitly_wait(n)`. In my experience with the Gecko driver, this can fail when chaining operations such as `li.find_element_by_class_name('a-link-normal').click()`
# * Depending on what is needed on a page, wait for that explicitly via `WebDriverWait(driver, n)`
#
# See https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html for more information.

# %%
# Tell selenium to wait up to 5 seconds for desired elements to exist
driver.implicitly_wait(5)

# %%
# implicity_wait works here
dropdown = driver.find_element_by_class_name('a-dropdown-container')
dropdown.click()

# %%
# sort by 'Price: Low to High'
# implicity_wait often fails here
# time.sleep(2)
driver.find_element_by_id('s-result-sort-select_1').click()

# %%
# despite search terms, some small SDCards are shown
# click on the filter link on the left
li = driver.find_element_by_id('p_n_feature_two_browse-bin/13203835011')
li_class = li.find_element_by_class_name('a-link-normal')
li_class.click()

# %%
product_desc = []
product_price = []

products = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector('.sg-col.sg-col-4-of-12.sg-col-8-of-16.sg-col-12-of-20')
for p in products:
    product_desc.append(
        # product names/descriptions can be very long. just get first 50 characterss
        p.find_element_by_css_selector('.a-size-medium.a-color-base.a-text-normal').text[:50]
    )
    
    dollars = p.find_elements_by_class_name('a-price-whole')
    price = None
    if len(dollars) > 0:
        price = float(dollars[0].text)
    cents = p.find_elements_by_class_name('a-price-fraction')
    if len(cents) > 0:
        price = price + float('0.' + cents[0].text)
    product_price.append(price)

# %% [markdown]
# In order to build a dataframe from this information, both lists must be the same lenght. Check to make sure first

# %%
len(product_desc)

# %%
len(product_price)

# %%
pd.DataFrame({'product':product_desc,
              'price':product_price
              })

# %% [markdown]
# ### Cleaning up
#
# When finished, make sure you close the browser. Can either `driver.quit()` or `driver.close()`. `.close()` will close open tabs. If you close the last tab, it is the same as calling `.quit()`

# %%
driver.quit()

# %%
try:
    driver.close()
except Exception:
    print('Already closed')

# %%
